              We do not consider anonymized information to constitute personal
              information as it cannot be used to identify a specific person. We
              collect personal information from you when you use healthigo.com
              or its related websites and services ("Site") (including, without
              limitation, when you telephone or email our customer support
              team). By providing us with your personal information you
              expressly consent to us processing your personal information in

              information How you can contact us about privacy questions Our
              collection of your personal information As part of your
              registration on the Site, you will be asked to provide us with
              certain personal information, such as your name, email address
              and/or telephone number and other similar information as well as
              some additional information about you such as your date of birth
              or other identifying information. Additionally, in order for us to
              verify your identity, we may need to request from you valid proof
              of identification (e.g. in the form of a copy of your passport,
              resident’s visa or permit, national ID card and/or driver’s
              license). We will also need to collect selected financial
              information from you, such as your credit card and/or bank account
              details. You will need to input this financial information into
              the "My Account" section of the Site. We use this financial
              information for billing purposes and for the fulfilment of your
              orders. Following your registration on the Site, you should not
              post any personal information (including any financial
              information) anywhere on the Site other than on the My Account
              section of the Site. Restricting the posting of personal
              information to the My Account section of the Site protects you
              from the possibility of fraud or identity theft. The posting by
              you of any personal information anywhere on the Site other than on
              the My Account section of the Site may lead to the suspension of
              your use of the Site.
